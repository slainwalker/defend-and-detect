# Types of Phishing Emails

Phishing emails appear in different forms depending on the attacker's intent — ranging from stealing credentials to deploying malware or tricking users into performing unauthorized actions. Recognizing the type is crucial for efficient triage and response.

---

## 1. Spear Phishing

Targeted emails tailored to specific individuals or roles (e.g., executives, finance, HR). These messages often reference internal tools or data to appear legitimate.

**Common traits:**
- Personalized subject lines or greetings
- References to specific departments, projects, or names
- Spoofed or lookalike email domains

---

## 2. Malware Delivery Phishing

Phishing emails carrying malicious attachments or links that initiate malware downloads.

**Common traits:**
- File types: .zip, .exe, .docm, .xlsm, .pdf (with malicious macros)
- Password-protected attachments
- Email body often mimics job applications, invoices, or delivery notices

---

## 3. Credential Harvesting

Emails that link to fake login portals designed to steal credentials.

**Common traits:**
- Claims of account issues or suspicious login activity
- Links that mimic Microsoft, Google, or banking logins
- URL mismatches or shorteners (hover to verify)

---

## 4. Business Email Compromise (BEC)

Attacks that impersonate executives, clients, or vendors to request unauthorized wire transfers, data access, or credentials.

**Common traits:**
- Use of display name spoofing (legitimate-looking names with fake emails)
- Time-sensitive financial or HR-related requests
- Avoidance of attachments or links (to bypass filters)

---

## 5. Government or Authority Impersonation

Phishing emails pretending to be from tax departments, law enforcement, or legal bodies to scare the target into taking action.

**Common traits:**
- Threats of legal consequences or penalties
- Branding copied from official entities (IRS, FBI, Income Tax Dept.)
- Demands for immediate response, documents, or payment

---

## 6. Lottery and Prize Scams

Claims of winning money, gadgets, or vouchers intended to lure users into providing personal or payment details.

**Common traits:**
- Promises of large prizes with small “shipping” fees
- Use of urgent call-to-action language
- Links to fake prize claim pages or short forms

---

## 7. Delivery and Invoice Scams

Phishing posing as missed deliveries or fake invoices, often impersonating logistics or e-commerce companies.

**Common traits:**
- Claims of failed deliveries or pending invoices
- Spoofed logos of brands like Amazon, DHL, or FedEx
- Malicious attachments or tracking links

---

## 8. Tech Support Scams

Emails pretending to be from internal or external IT teams, warning about infections or required software updates.

**Common traits:**
- Claims that your device is infected or outdated
- Prompts to install remote access tools
- Requests to call a toll-free number or click a software update link

---

## 9. Spam (Commercial or Unsolicited Content)

Not all unsolicited emails are phishing. Some may simply be marketing, clickbait, or promotional spam. Depending on the organization’s policies, these may or may not require intervention.

**Examples:**
- Marketing emails from unknown vendors
- Crypto giveaways or trading platforms
- SEO services, adult content, or fake business proposals

**Note:** Spam can sometimes be a **cover for malware** or phishing, so headers and links should still be reviewed if user-reported.

## Bonus: Non-Phishing Threats That May Need Action

Not every suspicious email is phishing — some are internal threats or scams that still require IR follow-up:

### Internal Compromise
- Phishing-like messages coming from a **legitimate corporate address**
- Signs include abnormal send times, suspicious links, or changes in tone/language
- Needs immediate escalation and possibly account isolation

### Malspam
- Emails with malware attached but no social engineering — may be detected by AV/SIEM
- Examples include Emotet, TrickBot droppers

### Scam/Advance-Fee Emails
- Common "Nigerian prince", business opportunity, or donation scams
- Often poorly written, but may fool less tech-savvy users

### Social Engineering Requests (Non-email)
- Emails prompting actions like calling a fake help desk or visiting a kiosk
- Bypass traditional phishing markers — may need awareness training

## Final Notes

Phishing detection is context-driven. Even emails that seem harmless may be part of broader campaigns. When in doubt:

- Review headers and links
- Check domain/IP reputation
- Escalate if there's uncertainty or any active user engagement
